## Setup and Installation
> Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have `Python 3.8` or newer installed on your system. 
You can download it from `python.org`.

2. Clone the Repository
First, clone this project's repository to your local machine.

Bash

`git clone https://github.com/aryanrajyaguru22/AI-Healthcare-Chatbot`
`cd AI-Healthcare-chatbot`

3. Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

__*For Windows:*__

Bash

`python -m venv venv`
`venv\Scripts\activate`

__*For macOS/Linux:*__

Bash

`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install Dependencies

Bash

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The main dependencies are:

`streamlit`

`google-generativeai`

`python-dotenv`

5. Set Up Your API Key
The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function.

Get your API key from Google AI Studio.

In the project's root directory, create a file named .env.

Open the .env file and add your API key in the following format:

GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with the key you obtained.

## Note: If you are using the version of the code where the API key is hardcoded, you can skip this step.

## How to Run the Project
